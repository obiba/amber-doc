Introduction
============

The Amber Visit application is the interview data collection web interface of the Amber server. The Interview Designs that are enabled can be used to conduct interviews, either self-administered by the participant or with the help of a dedicated interviewer.

Using Amber Visit requires authentication. A participant will provide its personal code (and optionally a password), an interviewer will use its Amber credentials (user name, password and 2FA code).

**No personal information is stored in the app** after the interview has been completed: private data are automatically saved on the Amber server (as soon as the network is accessible).

Requirements
------------

This web interface is a JavaScript application requiring a modern web browser. There is no requirement regarding the operating system: it can be either a desktop or a mobile one.
