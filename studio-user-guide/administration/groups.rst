Groups
======

Grouping users can be convenient when specific permissions are to be granted, for instance when a Case Report Form has limited access.

List of groups
--------------

From the list of groups the following operations are available:

Add a group
~~~~~~~~~~~

When creating a group, a name is required, a description is optional.

Delete group(s)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are different ways of deleting a group:

* Either select one or more groups in the list and press the Delete selected groups button,
* Or press a specific group's Delete action button.

Note that the users that are members of the group are not deleted.

Single group
------------

To edit the details of a group, click on the group's name or the pencil icon.

The form allows to:

* Edit the name and/or description of the group,
* Lookup users to be added as group members,
* Remove members from the group.
